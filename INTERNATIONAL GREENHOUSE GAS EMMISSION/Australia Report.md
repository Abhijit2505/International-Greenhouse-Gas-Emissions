# 1. Australia
![AUSTRALIAN EMISSION DATA](https://github.com/Wealthy-Waste/International-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions/blob/master/INTERNATIONAL%20GREENHOUSE%20GAS%20EMMISSION/AUSTRALIA.png)

As the plot explains, Australia produces CO2 maximum,moderate amount of CH4 and NO2, with a very small amount of N2O as per the available data.
This indirectly means,
* Australian industry broadly consists of mining, manufacturing, and construction,Energy Production,Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU),
Transport, industries like - paper, food, petroleum refineries, chemicals and metal/mineral products & Residential, Commercial and Institutional Sectors, that are considered as
carbon intensive industries.
* Moderate emission of CH4 means, two aspects, one is the decay of organic wastes and other one is the production of oil and natural gas.
  * Australia holds 1,193,000,000 barrels of proven oil reserves as of 2016, ranking 38th in the world and accounting for about 0.1% of the world's total oil reserves.
Australia has proven reserves equivalent to 2.9 times its annual consumption. Oil and Natutal gas production industries in Australia are the main
emitters of CH4.

  * Australians waste too much of food.The whole the country throws away three million tonnes of food per year. 
    That’s 145 kilograms per person, costing $6 billion. That’s enough to food to feed us all for three weeks. May be this creates the most
    amount of the Organic Waste of the region. One important fact is that, Australia provides the service of commercial **"Worm Farms"**, that is using Worms for
    the decomposition of organic waste. Farmers in Australia rely on compost and the municipalities have compost bins provided to the public use.
    This may be a secondary reason for this much CH4 emission.
 * In Australia, nitric acid is used to produce ammonium nitrate, and it is used by manufacturing companies to produce organic nitrates 
 and inorganic nitrates. N2O is emitted during the production of HNO3.The Australia nitric acid market is expected to be valued at US$ 725.3 Mn in 2016 
 and is expected to grow 1.8X by the end of 2024 to be valued at US$ 1.3 Bn.The Australia nitric acid market is witnessing a new trend in the form of capacity expansions. In order to cater to an 
 increasing demand for explosives from the mining industry, ammonium nitrate manufacturers in Australia are expanding their existing 
 production facilities and are focusing on new production capacity additions.

These are the three most emitted GHG of Australia.

Some adverse effect of this include the change of **climate** and **temperature** in Australia.
In 2013, the CSIRO reported that Australia is becoming hotter, with an average increase of 1 degree 
celcius anually, and that it will experience more extreme heat and longer fire seasons because of the climate change.
In 2014, the Bureau of Meteorology released a report on the state of Australia's climate that highlighted
several key points, including the increase in Australia's temperatures and the increasing frequency of bush fires, droughts and 
floods, which have all been linked to climate change.[Source - Wikipedia]

This briefly explains the output we can find from the data involved.
