## New Zealand

![New Zealand Analysis](https://github.com/Wealthy-Waste/International-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions/blob/master/INTERNATIONAL%20GREENHOUSE%20GAS%20EMMISSION/Newzealand%20analysis.png)

Accoring to the dataset available, New Zealand emits greenhouse gases which consists of around 45% CH4, 43% CO2 and around 11% N2O.This
indirectly means,

* Methane emission occurs mainly because of Oil and Natural gas production and agricultural emission. In 2018, New Zealand's 
self-sufficiency in oil was 17%, i.e. the country imports its petroleum product needs. 
All local oil production is exported as the New Zealand refinery is not suited to processing it [Source - Wikipedia].

    So, New Zealand is unusual among developed countries with its strong base in primary production and a high proportion of electricity 
generated from renewable sources. As a result, almost half of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions come from **agriculture**, 
in the form of **methane** and **nitrous oxide**.

    The agriculture sector contributed 48 percent of New Zealand’s gross emissions in 2014. Methane accounts for 43 percent of all emissions 
(from all sources). More than 80 percent of New Zealand’s total methane comes from ruminant farm animals – cattle, sheep,goats and deer
– mainly as a result of enteric fermentation. The great majority of that comes from the rumen, the enlarged modified foregut of ruminant 
animals. Only about three percent comes from animal manure.
    
    In New Zealand, most nitrous oxide is produced by the action of soil bacteria 
in urine patches in paddocks.  Smaller amounts come from dung deposited during grazing, stored manures spread back onto pasture, and from 
nitrogen fertilizer. 

* As the following graph explains, most of the emission of CO2 is happened by **Transport** and **Manufacturing industry**.

  * Agriculture 
  * Energy 
  * Industrial processes and product use (IPPU)
  * Waste 
  * Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): The LULUCF sector keeps track of greenhouse gases from land use 
  (eg, for forests, crops, and pasture). This is separate from the livestock emissions reported in the Agriculture sector. 
  It covers our use of soil, trees, plants, biomass, and timber and is the only sector where carbon dioxide is removed from the 
  atmosphere.

   **Gross emissions** are the total emissions from the **Agriculture**, **Energy**, **IPPU** and **Waste sectors**. Net emissions are 
   gross emissions combined with emissions and removals from the **LULUCF** sector.
