# Analysis Report

This report has a step by step analysis of data, that can be helpful in getting the final research output. Report is going to be continued
and updated patch by patch as we move further.

### 1 . Analysing the Data WRT Gas Names and Country

**A]** Let's take the first eight countries namely - **Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada,Croatia,Cyprus** and analyse the emission
of **CH4** from 1990-2014 (data available till 2014).

![1990-2004 CH4 1](https://github.com/Wealthy-Waste/International-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions/blob/master/INTERNATIONAL%20GREENHOUSE%20GAS%20EMMISSION/Analysis-1.png)
It is a plot from 1990-2004 for the emission of CH4 in the above mentioned countries.

ðŸ”¸**Key Questions**

 * From 1990, the emission for *Canada* rised, especially from 1990-1998, it has a great increase in the slope of curve. What is the reason ?
 * On the otherhand, the curve for *Australia* got a negative slope, why ?
 * Countries other than Australia and Canada, has a maximum emission of 20000 Kilotonnes, What is the reason of this much gap in amount emitted
   between Australia, Canada and the other countries ?
