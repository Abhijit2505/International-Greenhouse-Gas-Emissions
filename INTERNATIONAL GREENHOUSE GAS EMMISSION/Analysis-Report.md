# Analysis Report

This report has a step by step analysis of data, that can be helpful in getting the final research output. Report is going to be continued
and updated patch by patch as we move further.

### 1 . Analysing the Data WRT Gas Names and Country

**A]** Let's take the first eight countries namely - **Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada,Croatia,Cyprus** and analyse the emission
of **CH4** from 1990-2014 (data available till 2014).

![1990-2004 CH4 1](https://github.com/Wealthy-Waste/International-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions/blob/master/INTERNATIONAL%20GREENHOUSE%20GAS%20EMMISSION/Analysis-1.png)
It is a plot from 1990-2004 for the emission of CH4 in the above mentioned countries.

ðŸ”¸**Key Questions**

 * From 1990, the emission for *Canada* rised, especially from 1990-1998, it has a great increase in the slope of curve. What is the reason ?
 * On the otherhand, the curve for *Australia* got a negative slope, why ?
 * Countries other than Australia and Canada, has a maximum emission of 20000 Kilotonnes, What is the reason of this much gap in amount emitted
   between Australia, Canada and the other countries ?

ðŸ”¹**Answers**
 * Before 1990, from 1950-1900, industrial work was at a peak in Canada. Cars, airplanes, steel, chemicals, appliances and other
   consumer goods were manufactured in Canada.
   By the 1960s and 1970s, approximately 30 per cent of the Canadian working population was in a union, often anÂ industrial union. Major    firms andÂ manufacturingÂ companies such asÂ Massey-Ferguson,Â Bombardier,Â General Motors of Canada, the Dominion Steel and Coal            Corporation and A.V. Roe Canada Limited dotted the industrial landscape. Till 1990, Canada has  fot a very good boost over their        industrial(inclding Chemical) and automobile development, This can be one of the major reason for the increase in slope from 1990-      1995.
   After 1994, the rate of emission of CH4 declined, that may happened due to two reasons - First being the trade agreements such as        theÂ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization, and regional trade pacts such as the Canada-United States Free      Trade Agreement (1989) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (1994). Those trade deals effectively dismantled the protectionist    approach of theÂ National Policy. Hence the decrease in rate.
   Meanwhile, automation, innovation and productivity increases meant that fewer workers were necessary to produce manufactured goods.
   In the 2000s, auto assembly in Ontario faced restructuring and decline. The 1965Â Auto Pact, a managed trade agreement that provided      some guarantees for production in Canada, was found contrary to international trade rules, and the North American economy faced the      financial crisis of 2008â€“09.

After 2010, With an increasing amount of industrial work done by automation, including robotic processes, manufacturing work became less of a segment of the industrial economy. At the same time, computerization shifted much of the modern economy into the service sector, withÂ retail,Â bankingÂ and finance,Â communicationsÂ and other aspects of theÂ economyÂ outpacing manufacturing.
